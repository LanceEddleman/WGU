 * Magic squares. 
 * An  matrix that is filled with the numbers is a magic square if the sum of the elements in each row, in each column, and in the two diagonals is the same value.
 * 16 | 3 | 2 | 13
 * 5 | 10 | 11 | 8
 * 9 | 6 | 7 | 12
 * 4 | 15 | 14 | 1
 * Write a program that reads in 16 values from the keyboard and tests whether they form a magic square when put into a  array.
 * You need to test two features:
 * 1. Does each of the numbers  occur in the user input?
 * 2. When the numbers are put into a square, are the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals equal to each other?
